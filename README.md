# vowel-interpolation
This project has been conducted in my intership at the LAM lab in Paris. The project attempt to synthesize interpolated vowels using LSF, an LPC descriptor

# Files
Main functions:
interpolate_vowels.m: given two recording of vowels, it performs synthesis of the interpolation between the two.
coef_n_residual.m: given a list of files, it analyse every file and outputs the result in the 'output' folder

Other files are auxiliary files
